Language Specification (Wiki) for twinBASIC

This GitHub repository is for managing the Language Specification (Wiki) for the twinBASIC programming language.

twinBASIC is a BASIC language that is backwards compatible with classic VB6 and VBA.  As such, many of the language constructs overlap, but twinBASIC introduces many improvements and extensions.  These additions need to be documented formally, and this is the place to do that.

This repository is a work-in-progress.  Please join us to help create a formal specification for the languange constructs used in twinBASIC.
